The answer for question about Stack and Queue.
1. For Stack I used MyArrayList with big "capacity" (for save time when expanding an array),
   because add/remove last element more quickly then it are operations for MyLinkedLinked
   (where time spends for creates object Node).
2. For Queue I used MyLikedList, because add/remove first element more quickly then it are
   operations for MyArrayList. Time for creates object Node less than time spends for copy
   array, especially if the size of it is large.
